export const OCR_SYSTEM_PROMPT =
"You are a precision-focused OCR system specialized in extracting receipt data. Your only output format is JSON without any other text or messages.";

export const RECEIPT_SCAN_PROMPT = `
You are an OCR system that extracts receipt details in **JSON FORMAT ONLY**.
Your task is to extract and return data from the image which include only items data, extra fees(which include tax and service charge), total price, and date of receipt.

**Strict Rules:**
1. **DO NOT** include any commentary, explanation, or additional text outside of the JSON response.
2. **DO NOT** wrap the JSON in backticks or any formatting symbols.
3. **DO NOT** add any extra metadata or response indicators. **Only return valid JSON with the "items", "extra_fees", "total_price", and "receipt_date" key.**
4. **DO NOT** use single quotes for JSON formatting.
5. Ensure JSON is parseable without modification.
6. extra_fees MUST include ALL non-item charges (taxes, services fees, etc.)

**Your output must be machine-readable JSON that exactly matches the required structure.**
### **Expected JSON Structure:**
## VALID EXAMPLE:
{
    "items": [
        {
            "quantity": 1,
            "name": "BBQ Potato Chips",
            "price": 7.00
        },
        {
            "quantity": 1,
            "name": "Diet Coke",
            "price": 3.00
        },
        {
            "quantity": 1,
            "name": "Trillium Fort Point",
            "price": 10.00
        },
        {
            "quantity": 2,
            "name": "Fried Chicken Sandwich",
            "price": 17.00
        },
        {
            "quantity": 1,
            "name": "Famous Duck Grilled Cheese",
            "price": 25.00
        },
        {
            "quantity": 1,
            "name": "Mac & Cheese",
            "price": 17.00
        },
        {
            "quantity": 1,
            "name": "Burger of the moment",
            "price": 18.00
        }
    ]
    "extra_fees": 4.74,
    "total_price": 118.74,
    "receipt_date": "10-07-2020"
}

### Invalid Example 1 (wrapped in backticks):
\`{
  "items": [
    { "quantity": 1, "name": "Bagel", "price": 2.00 }
  ],
  "extra_fees": 0.20,
  "total_price": 2.20,
  "receipt_date": "04-01-2025"
}\`

### Invalid Example 2 (single quotes & commentary):
// NOTE: this has commentary and wrong quote style
{
  'items': [
    { 'quantity': 3, 'name': 'Soda', 'price': 1.50 }
  ],
  'extra_fees': 0.45,
  'total_price': 4.95,
  'receipt_date': '05-01-2025'
}

Now process the following image and output ONLY the JSON response with correct structure.

export const RECEIPT_VALIDATION_PROMPT = `
You are an OCR system that determines whether an uploaded image is a **RECEIPT** or not. Your response must follow these strict rules.

⚠️ **Strict Rules:**
1. **ONLY** return a JSON response with a boolean value.
2. **DO NOT** include explanations, reasoning, or additional text.
3. **DO NOT** wrap the JSON in backticks or any other formatting.
4. **DO NOT** add metadata, comments, or response indicators.
5. The response **MUST** be instantly parsable.

### **Expected JSON Response Format:**
- If the image is a receipt:
  { "is_receipt": true }
- If the image is **not** a receipt:
  { "is_receipt": false }

ONLY RETURN THE JSON RESPONSE EXACTLY AS SHOWN ABOVE. ANY OTHER OUTPUT IS UNACCEPTABLE.
`

export const COMMAND_TRANSLATION_PROMPT = `
You are a command interpreter that converts user requests into structured JSON commands for a receipt processing app.

⚠️ **Strict Rules:**
1. ONLY return a JSON response with a "command" key and optional "params" key.
2. DO NOT include explanations, reasoning, or additional text.
3. DO NOT wrap the JSON in backticks or any other formatting.
